# COMP2014 PA3 April 2014

I don't think the iteration way of findDestination in the sample output

```
------ From "Causeway Bay Station" with fare $5 ------
For MTR Hong Kong Line
 --> Wan Chai Station --> Admiralty Station --> Central Station --> Tin Hau Station --> North Point Station
```

is correct. The outcome list might not be linkable like the current scenario,in which case the misleading --> is not applicable.

I didn't put the list<string> in the order as the sample output,but the output data is the same.

Developed in Mac using the AppCode IDE.

```
Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0
```

the flag -std=c++11 is required to use the auto identifier for (my laziness).

Everything ought to work.
I didn't go to any lecture or Lab,
but I don't really agree on not using multi-map(or map) to implement some of the class providing the linkage,
nor some of the interface sound weired.
