# COMP2014 PA3 April 2014

I don't think the iteration way of findDestination in the sample output

```
------ From "Causeway Bay Station" with fare $5 ------
For MTR Hong Kong Line
 --> Wan Chai Station --> Admiralty Station --> Central Station --> Tin Hau Station --> North Point Station
```

is correct. The outcome list might not be linkable like the current scenario,in which case the misleading --> is not applicable.

I didn't put the list<string> in the order as the sample output,but the output data is the same.

```

the flag -std=c++11 is required to use the auto identifier for(my laziness)
